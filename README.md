This repository contains an example of a common error in Rust: creating a dangling pointer when working with raw pointers and vectors.  The `bug.rs` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version using safe Rust techniques.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in Rust to avoid undefined behavior and program crashes.
